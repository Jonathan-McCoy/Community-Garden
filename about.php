			<p>The Community Garden at UT Arlington, located at 406 Summit Avenue near the corner of UTA Blvd and Summit on the University of Texas in Arlington campus, offers city residents more than just a place to grow vegetables.  The site is also a wonderful place to socialize, make friends from many walks of life, enjoy the rich colors, textures, and smells of an open-air garden, and share in the bounty of fresh, locally grown, pesticide-free produce.</p>

			<p>The half-acre garden supports Arlington's commitment to sustainability by (1) educating the community about preserving and repurposing green space; (2) utilizing compost, mulch, and legacy gardening techniques to raise healthful crops without toxic chemicals; and (3) promoting water conservation through rain-harvesting cisterns and smart-yard watering.</p>

			<p>Since the project's inception in 2011, the Community Garden at UTA has produced more than 12,000 pounds of produce, fruit, and herbs, a portion of which has been donated to local food pantries.  Organizers say the garden has strengthened the university's bonds with the surrounding community while encouraging healthy, sustainable food options for Arlingtonians.  "The community garden is a great way to conserve water, produce fresh food for local consumption, and educate citizens about best management practices of organic gardening," says retired Assistant Director of Community Programs Bill Gilmore, unofficial godfather of the garden and one of its staunchest supporters.</p>

			<p>The garden is a 21,480-square-foot sanctuary consisting of 78 planting beds, including three accessible 4x16s and one 4x12 community seed plot. The garden is considered a sustainability project due to the rooftop runoff water collection and storage system that supplements city water usage. The site has everything you could want to satisfy your gardening needs, including garden tools, hose bibs, water hoses, and a storage shed. The yearly plot rental fee gives gardeners access to the equipment and water.  Compost and mulch are supplied by UTA on demand.  The facility itself includes mulched walkways, benches, crushed granite pathways, a shade arbor, accessible parking, and a university police call station.</p>
